Week 8 Assignment 

Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration  

Audio Reactive Visuals 

Audio reactive visuals use p5.js to create visuals which are generated/manipulated through sound. p5.js can read sound through amplitude or frequency which can be inputted through a microphone or by uploading a track into p5 and analysing the frequency using fft methods. Learning how to use the fft method can be useful for the major project as it can help us manipulate our groups chosen painting through reaction to different sounds. As we are considering mimicking an arcade game for our final project, it could be interesting to use arcade sounds to affect the representation of the painting
